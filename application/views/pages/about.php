            In the first quarter of 1987, with the intent to establish a primary hospital that would cater to the growing medical needs of the locality of Kidapawan, a group of six (6) medical doctors including two surgeons, an anesthesiologist, a pediatrician, an OB-Gynecologist, and an internist organized the Kidapawan Medical Specialists Center, Inc. (KMSCI).

            The response of the people of Kidapawan was favorable that in 1990, the incorporators decided to build a new hospital facility with updated medical equipment after purchasing a 1-hectare land in Brgy. Sudapin, Kidapawan City. They also started their operation as a Secondary General Hospital.<br><br>
The Kidapawan Medical Specialists Center, Inc. is presently a level 2 100-bed capacity, non-training private hospital. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, it operated at a peak of 200-bed capacity.<br><br>
With its growth and the opening of the modern OPD Complex, the active medical staff rose to almost a hundred in varied specialties and sub-specialties, which include but are not limited to Ophthalmology, ENT, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Thoracic Surgery, Sleep Specialist, Rehabilitation Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Orthopedic, Nephrology, Urology, Dentistry, etc.<br><br>
In addition, the hospital has a Renal Dialysis Unit, Heart Station, Respiratory Therapy Unit, and CT Scan services. It has the most modern and biggest ICU complex in the entire province of Cotabato. Furthermore, it has a dedicated ICU for Airborne isolation patients since KMSCI is a DOH-certified Covid-19 referral facility. The hospitalâ€™s Medical Laboratory and Radiology departments have the latest high technology machines and equipment.<br><br>
Kidapawan Medical Specialists Center, Inc. is now considered the most progressive and the best health care institution in the province. As a result of its excellent and quality service, the KMSCI was recognized and awarded as a Center of Quality by the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation accreditation body in 2010.<br><br>
